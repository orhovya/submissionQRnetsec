This project is a QR attack using the submission system site.
The project is devided into 3 parts:
1. python code that generates a qr code
- this qr code will redirect to the fake submission system html.
2. submission system html which is :
- the css files
- the images of the site
- the html itself 
the html is made to look exactly like the submission system site with one main change,
  when loging in using it the username and password are sent simultaniusly to the server and to remove docs file in the web
  for saving the creds.
